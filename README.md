## 📈 Microsoft Stock – Time Series Analysis

**Problem:** Analyze and model Microsoft (MSFT) daily stock price behavior from 2015 to 2021

**Type:** Time Series Analysis

**Domain:** Finance / Stock Market Analytics

**Techniques Used**

* Trend visualization and monthly resampling of daily OHLCV data
* Stationarity testing using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
* First differencing to achieve stationarity (d=1 confirmed)
* Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) analysis
* 120-day moving average smoothing
* STL decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components
* ARIMA(1,1,1) forecasting with 12-month holdout evaluation
* GARCH(1,1) volatility modeling to capture volatility clustering
* Log return computation and cross-column correlation analysis
* Granger Causality test (Volume → High price)

**Evaluation Metrics**

* ADF test statistic and p-value (stationarity)
* MAE and RMSE on held-out 12-month forecast window (ARIMA)
* Conditional volatility series (GARCH)

**Key Findings**

* Raw price series is non-stationary; first differencing achieves stationarity
* ACF shows near-perfect persistence across all lags — trend dominates
* STL confirms trend as the primary structural component
* GARCH conditional volatility peaks sharply in March 2020 (COVID crash)
* Granger Causality evaluated at lags 1–5 for Volume → High predictive power

**Highlight**

* Covers the full time series workflow from EDA to forecasting to volatility modeling.
* Bridges classical statistical methods (ARIMA, ADF) with financial risk modeling (GARCH).
* COVID-19 market shock is clearly visible and captured across multiple analyses.

## 🏥 Symptom Disease Classification – NLP Text Classification
 
**Problem:** Classify patient diseases based on symptom profiles using NLP and deep learning techniques
 
**Type:** Multi-Class Text Classification
 
**Domain:** Healthcare / NLP
 
**Techniques Used**
 
* Binary symptom feature matrix construction from 132 structured symptom columns
* Symptom-to-text conversion for sequence modeling (e.g., `"itching fever nodal skin eruptions"`)
* Multinomial Naive Bayes on binary feature vectors
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel
* Bidirectional LSTM RNN with TextVectorization embedding layer
* Early stopping and dropout regularization for RNN training
* Label encoding for multi-class target with `LabelEncoder`
* Model comparison via weighted precision, recall, and F1 score
 
**Evaluation Metrics**
 
* Precision (weighted)
* Recall (weighted)
* F1 Score (weighted)
* Per-class `classification_report`
 
**Highlight**
 
* Compares traditional NLP (NB, SVM) against a modern deep learning approach (Bidirectional LSTM) on the same classification task.
* Demonstrates full NLP pipeline: feature extraction → vectorization → modeling → evaluation.
* Highlights the importance of dataset quality in NLP — an initial synthetic dataset with low symptom-disease signal was identified and replaced through diagnostic analysis.
